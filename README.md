## Abstract
Continuous expansion in the fields of science and technology has led to the immense availability and attainability of data in every field. Fundamentally understanding and analyzing this data is a critical job in the decision-making process. Although, great success has been achieved by the prevailing data engineering and mining techniques, the problem of swift classification of the imbalanced data still exists in academia and industry. A potential solution to the problem of skewness in data can be resolved by data upsampling or downsampling. There exists a few techniques that firstly remove skewness and then perform classification, however, these methods suffer from hurdles like abortive precision or slower learning rate. In this paper, a hybrid method to classify binary imbalanced data using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique followed by Extreme Learning Machine is proposed. Our method along with swift learning rate is efficacious to predict the desired class. We verified our model using five standard imbalance dataset and obtained higher F-measure, G-mean and ROC score for all the dataset.

## Result
The proposed hybrid scheme of combining SMOTE for upsampling with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are compared against a combination of various other hybrid models. 
In this work, four different models, namely Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), ELM, K-Means (each with original data, upsampling data using SMOTE and downsampling data using CNN+T-Link) along with W-ELM (weighted ELM) have been compared against each other. We compared results on three performance measures, Geometric mean (G-mean), F-score and ROC, using five standard datasets (pima, vehicle, ecoli, segment and yeast) having different imbalance ratio (shown below) for examining the robustness. Based on the evaluation metrics (including the training time), the results of the experiments showed that our model is better than other generally used models for imbalance datasets.
